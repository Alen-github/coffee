                        A black eye coffee is a very simple drink. It’s a cup of normal drip coffee, either iced or hot,
                        with a double shot of espresso. The name is said to have come from the way the coffee looks when you
                        add the shots in, but we think the name comes from the fact that this drink feels like a punch to
                        the face. This thing will seriously wake you up, and it’s obvious why
